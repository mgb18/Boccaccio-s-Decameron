                <td class="front">Once we established our research question, our biggest concern was
                    answering the question, "how?" In order to try to establish whether or not The
                    Decameron was a feminist text, we had to find a way to measure the relative
                    "feminism" present in The Decameron. Eventually we got the idea to tag the
                    speech and actions for certain attributes that we thought might be good
                    indicators to whether or not Boccaccio truly wrote The Decameron for women. We
                    did this by picking attributes, such as manipulative, clever, violent, passive,
                    assertive, etc., and assigning those attributes to a gender. If Boccaccio leaned
                    towards more stereotypical depictions of women, i.e., women being docile, naive,
                    and not actively engaging in aggressive or sexual behavior, we coudl deduce that
                    the text was not feminist, and vice versa. We tagged the action attributes with
                    "span" tags, and the speech attributes with "said" tags. The attribute for
                    gender, when someone has done an action, was "resp", the gender for what someone
                    said was "who". For both actions and speech we used "style". We only gave one
                    tag per action or speech, and used our best judgement to determine which
                    attribute was most appropriate in each situation. Of course, our tags are
                    somewhat subjective, but for further clarity, please refer to the charts below
                    for a detailed description of each attribute. </td>
