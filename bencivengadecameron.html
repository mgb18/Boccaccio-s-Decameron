        <h2><i>Our Project</i></h2>
        <p> This project is going to explore the women in Boccaccio's Decameron in an attempt to see
            if this piece of Italian literature can really be considered to be a femininist tale. </p>
        <h3><i>Background on the text</i></h3>
        <p> For those who may not be familiar, the Decameron is a collection of short stories
            written by Giovanni Boccaccio, and were originally in Italian. There are a hundred
            stories in total, and they are broken up into "Days" in which there are ten in total,
            and each day ten different stories are told. Despite the sexual and occassionally light
            hearted spirit of the stories, the stories date back to the Fourteenth Century and take
            place during the time of the Black Death. </p>
