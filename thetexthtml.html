        <h2><i>The History</i></h2>
        <p>The Decameron was written in fourteenth century by Italian author Giovanni Boccaccio. It
            is considered to be a classic work of early Italian literature. The Decameron takes
            place during the time in which the black death ravaged the city of Florence. Indeed, the
            black death served as Boccaccio's inspiration for the tale. Thus the story of ten
            people, seven young women and three young men, fleeing from an ailing Florence, who get
            through the harrowing ordeal by telling each other stories.</p>
        <h2><i>The Setting</i></h2>
        <p>Each of the stories is told in a fictional villa outside of Florence. The characters
            gather in a garden outside the villa, and tell each other stories that take place in a
            multitidue of locals, cities to hidden castles.</p>
        <h2><i>The Stories</i></h2>
        <p>Each story is told by one particular story teller. Each day has a set theme dictated by
            one of the characters. The theme can be along the lines of romance or trickery. However,
            it is important to note that the Decameron is known for its raunchy tales filled with
            sexual exploits people don't typically associate with the such an ancient text. It is
            the humorous and at times explicit stories that The Decameron is known for.</p>
